## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze historical electricity consumption data to predict peak usage. This can be beneficial for energy providers and consumers alike, as it enables more efficient resource allocation and demand management.

## Data
The dataset (data.csv) is loaded and processed for analysis. This file should be located in a data/ directory. Ensure that the data has columns compatible with the preprocessing steps in the notebook.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run this project:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these dependencies via pip:


    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/daunnn/Predict_Electricity_Peak_Consumption
    
Navigate to the project directory:


    cd your-repo-name
    
Open and run the Project.ipynb notebook in Jupyter:

    jupyter notebook Project.ipynb

## Results
The project provides visualizations and analysis of the electricity consumption trends, as well as predictive modeling results. These insights can help identify peak usage times and patterns.
